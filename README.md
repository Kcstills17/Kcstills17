# Hello I'm Zane 

I'm a Software engineer with years of experience in the Ruby and Javascripts ecosystems. I love solving problems and creating new applications.

When I'm not creating things as a developer I love to play basketball and study and learn Japanese. 

I have Co-created **Retriever**, an open-source observability platform that transforms distributed traces into LLM-queryable insights. Check out the Write up on it [here](https://runretriever.app/)!

Before Retriever, I built **Request Basket**, a full-stack webhook inspection tool, and **Goku Chat Bot**, a RAG-powered manga recommendation system using vector embeddings and semantic search.
